![RAW disk](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/usb3.jpg?resize=674%2C142&ssl=1 "usb3")

When we want to format the USB flash drive, the display cannot be formatted.

![Windows can't format](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/usb4.jpg?resize=452%2C259&ssl=1 "usb4")

All of these are different Examples of U disk failure. The main reason for these failures is that the MBR of U disk is damaged, which makes Windows unable to recognize the file system of U disk.

After these faults occur, we first suggest using the repairing tools provided by [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk) to repair the damaged U disk. The windows built-in chkdsk are relatively safe and can be used safely. The success rate for repair is about 50%.
