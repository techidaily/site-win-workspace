Sometimes it is useful to be able to create persistent variables in a macro that can be seen by other macros. As far as I know, if the user of emeditor wants to pass variables around between different macros, this can be done already in the following ways:  
 1) use the windows clipboard;  
 2) use the windows registry;  
 3) use a temporary text file;  
 One problem with all of these methods is they can be a bit slow and cumbersome to use on a regular basis. Is it possible to create a macro that can directly read and write to temporary registers such as is possible with Vim or Emacs?

 No, there are no global variables, unfortunately. I would suggest writing a sub-function to handle global variables in one of the above ways.
