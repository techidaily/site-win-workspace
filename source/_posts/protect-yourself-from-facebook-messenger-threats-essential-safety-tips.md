## What is Facebook Messenger Virus?

Facebook Messenger Virus is basically a malicious file spread through the Messenger platform. Users receive the nasty Trojan from their trusted connection through a file, for example, a video or a link. In one of the attacks, the FormBook Trojan was spread through an archive file titled **“video\_13925.bz.”** On extracting this file, the FormBook gets activated. This Trojan is pretty harmful to the system as it is designed to steal personal information such as passwords, bank details, keystrokes, clipboard history, and more. FormBook Trojan can also open doors for the entry of other malicious programs like Spyware or Ransomware.

## What are the symptoms of the Facebook Messenger Virus attack?

The Facebook Messenger Virus might be hiding anywhere in the system and sneakingly spying on users or conducting other illicit activities. Since it disguises itself in the name of a legitimate and safe process, it is pretty challenging to detect the Facebook Messenger Virus. However, the system shows some common symptoms that might confirm the presence of Trojan malware. Here is the list of those indications:

* CPU usage suddenly rises than usual.
* The system lags frequently.
* Your browser is bombarded with malicious pop-ups.
* A random window is opened without the user’s initiation.
* Redirection to untrustworthy or suspicious sites.

## How did Facebook Messenger Virus infect my computer?

As already mentioned, Facebook Messenger Virus is spread through the Messenger platform of Facebook, hence the name. Victims receive the malicious file attachments through their trusted connections which are either compromised or trapped in a Phishing attack. They believe since the attachment is sent through a friend, it can be relied on, and hence they open it and install the FormBook into their system. Sometimes the Trojan is delivered through a link, which looks like a link from YouTube, so victims open them without any suspicion or hesitation.

## How to remove Facebook Messenger Virus?

It is essential to get rid of Facebook Messenger Virus as it might conduct many illicit activities on your system and cause many losses. Here are the top ways to remove the FormBook Trojan from the system.

### ****Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If the Facebook Messenger Virus is still there on your PC, try to find the culprit application, i.e, FormBook, and uninstall it. 

1. Right-click on the taskbar and select the **Task Manager**.

### **Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free up valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.
4. Select all Files and Folders of this folder and delete them. Don’t hesitate to delete them, as they are not essential for any of your tasks. ![Delete temp files](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Delete-temp-files.png)
5. Next right-click on the **Recycle Bin** and select **Empty Recycle Bin.**![Empty recycle bin](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Empty-recycle-bin.jpg)
