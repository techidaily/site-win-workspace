I am very sorry that you had such a bad experience with EmEditor. Reliability and robustness are our top priority, and no features are more important than reliability and robustness. I will try to reproduce your issue and will fix it as soon as possible.

 If you want to create a very large file from scratch, by gradually increasing the size by adding a block of text, you might want to save the file at the point it reaches more than 300MB, and then reload the file and then you can continue your work more safely. 300MB is the default minimum size for EmEditor to use a temporary file to manage a very large file. Even if you reload the file, and if it still crashes, then you might need to adjust this size. This threshold size can be adjusted in the Advanced tab of the Customize dialog box. If EmEditor still crashes, then you might need to enter a smaller number, like 100MB. Then next time you open that large file (>100MB), EmEditor shouldn’t crash because it will open the file using a temporary file and will not rely only on the virtual memory.

 Nevertheless, EmEditor shouldn’t crash because of no memory situation, but it should display a dialog box to allow you to cancel the task gracefully. I sincerely apologize for this issue, and will try to fix this issue as soon as possible. I do appreciate your inputs. If you have further questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Thanks again.
