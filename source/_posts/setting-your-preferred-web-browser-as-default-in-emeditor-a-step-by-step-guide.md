I mean, by clicking links in the files  
 FAQ said it’s set during installation  
 can I change it without reinstalling everything?

You can change the default browser from the Windows Start menu > Set Program Access and Defaults.

thanks for your reply.  
 I’m confused. I have set firefox as the default browser in firefox already.  
 In “set program defaults”, the config I use is custom and browser is set to “use my current web browser” .  
 But when clicking links in emeditor, it use maxthon (my previous browser) instead.

You might want to go to Explorer > Tools menu > Folder Options > File Types tab and look for “(NONE) URL:HyperText Transfer Protocol”. I don’t recommend you change this setting manually, but I think this is what EmEditor (and other applications) typically uses to select a browser to open URLs with. I receive many claims with the similar FireFox issues. Do you use the latest version of FireFox installed properly on your system?

Yes, I’m using firefox 2.0.4\. I think it’s properly installed.  
 I have tried your suggestion and found that the HTT protocol is still using maxthon. After changing it back to firefox, it works now!  
 Thank you very much!
