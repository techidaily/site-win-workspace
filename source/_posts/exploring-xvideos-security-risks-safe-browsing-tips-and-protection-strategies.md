Well, to be precise, with such a vast user base, most of those are not tech-savvy, XVideos, and [other porn sites](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) are the best platform for cybercriminals to launch their malicious programs. So none of them can be considered entirely safe. 

With lots of tempting banner ads and pop up ads, if you click even one of them, you could infect your device with a virus or [other harmful malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)that can steal your private information and harm your device in many ways. Moreover, if not browsed anonymously, there is a possibility that your porn viewing habits can leak to the entire world. 

You have to keep in mind that nothing is free in this world, so if you are visiting porn sites for viewing free videos, then it will undoubtedly contain ads, and most of those ads would include malware programs. Even some videos may contain redirect viruses.

### **1\. Introduction of Viruses and Trojans to your system**

When you surf the porn sites like XVideos, you can infect your system with viruses and Trojans. In fact, Trojan is one of the prevalent malware that is spread through porn sites. Though the computer viruses are mostly harmless, they can slow down your system significantly and severely affect your workflow. 

They could also act as a gateway for other dangerous malware programs to enter your device.

### **2\. Adware and Pop-ups**

As already discussed, since XVideos is totally free for the users, its revenue mostly depends on the ads it displays on its webpages.

Since not every ad could be monitored, so cybercriminals take advantage and release the adware and malicious pop-ups in the form of those ads. An amateur user does not have much knowledge about how these ads work. So when an intriguing ad is displayed on the screen, the user automatically tends to click on it, and thus [adware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), and pop-ups get installed on the device.

Once they get an entry on your system, they will display more such ads, even when you are not browsing the XVideos anymore. This could be embarrassing for you if you share your device with your family members, especially kids. Your privacy is also infringed.

### **3\. Spyware**

[Spyware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) programs are more dangerous, especially while browsing porn sites like XVideos. The cybercriminals, after introducing the spyware on your system, can record your activities and things like your online behavior, or the type of porn you are interested in. This can further lead to **Sextortion,** explained in the next section.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### **4\. Sextortion Scam**

Sextortion is the evilest threat you are exposed to when you are not careful while browsing XVideos type sites. It is the practice of extorting money or sexual favors from someone by threatening them to reveal the evidence of their sexual habits or preferences.

The cybercriminal sends a mail to the victim that claims that their porn activities have been recorded using spyware. If they do not fulfill their demands, these pieces of evidence would be sent to their family, friends, or office colleagues.

Mostly these emails are a hoax, but there are cases where they happened to be real. You can not just take a risk.

## How to Protect your Privacy and Browse XVideos Safely?

It is a fact that most of the people (can’t say about you) do not spend more than 5-10 minutes on porn sites. But even in that short period, a lot could happen. So here is how you can protect your privacy and shield yourself from cybercrimes while browsing XVideos.

1. ****Always Use Incognito Mode**
2. ****Try to use VPN Services**
3. ****Never use your Social Profile to Log-in**
4. ****Do not click on Ads**
5. ****Do not Download Anything**
6. ****Install an Antimalware**

---

### **1\. Always Use Incognito Mode**

Well, this should not be told, right? It is a basic rule that while watching porn, you should always browse the sites in [incognito mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) to remain anonymous. That is how you can hide your history and cookies, and no adult page would be open while someone else uses your system. It will also ensure that no one else knows about your viewing habits.

### **2\. Try to use VPN Services**

Though it is not necessary, it is still recommended to use a good VPN service to stay fully anonymous while browsing XVideos and other pornography sites. VPN would hide your IP addresses while you browse the internet. Another advantage of using a VPN that one of my friends told me is, it could help you navigate the XVideos if your government censored it in your state or country. 

### **3\. Never use your Social Profile to Log-in**

This is again, not a thing to be told. If you want to be anonymous on XVideos, ever log-in with your social media profiles. Also, never enter your real name, email, and phone number.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### **4\. Do not click on Ads**

While you are on it, never get tricked by the attractive ads displayed on XVideos. They are mostly malicious, and if clicked, you can be a victim of phishing and other harmful malware attacks. Cybercriminals will try every trick to allure you. They would even promise to provide you more content in HD quality, but you should not fall for that trap.

Sometimes ads are placed in such a way that you could not avoid and click it by mistake. In such a case, immediately close the browser before you get redirected.

### **5\. Do not Download Anything**

You like a video and decided to keep it in your collection by downloading it. Avoid doing that. You never know, along with the video, you could also get your device infected with malware.

### **6\. Install an Antimalware**

Getting a proper antimalware solution will ensure that if by chance, any malware gets an entry on your system, your system would be ready to tackle it. So it is always recommended whether you are browsing porn sites or any other sites, install an antimalware like [MalwareFox](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) that can provide you real-time protection from online threats.

## Is XVideos Malware Site?

XVideos is flourishing with a base of millions of users. So if it were a malware site, why such a vast crowd visits it, certainly, it itself may not contain malware programs, it is the third-party ads and pop-ups that cause the problem.

One of the higher risks of XVideos is, like YouTube, it also contains user uploaded contents. By creating a free account, anybody can upload, download, and comment on the videos. So, we do not know whether the video uploaded is free of malware or not. 

Though XVideos claims they do not allow suspicious videos that appear to contain viruses, but since cybercriminals are getting advanced and not every upload could be monitored manually, there is always a risk of malware infection.

All in all, it is advised that if you really need to visit XVideos, remember all the precaution measures and do not spend much time on it.
