## User case: Windows 11 winload.efi missing, F8 button not working

My HP is not starting up. I’ve received the ‘winload efi is missing or corrupt’. All the troubleshooting steps require me to go into startup settings but in order for me to do that, I have to press F8 however when I do press it my screen flashes and it doesn’t take me there (this is on the blue ‘recovery’ screen with the error message). Can anyone help me please. I need to get back into my laptop. I can’t afford to reinstall the OS. Too much important files and data that I didn’t back up unfortunately.
