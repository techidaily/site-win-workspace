If you want to extract searched lines, you can “bookmark” searched lines (by pressing the “Bookmark All” button in the Find dialog), and then use the “Extract Bookmarked Lines to New File” command. You can also write a macro to automate this process.

 Sometimes a simple image or screenshot can explain better than many words. Can you show an image including a new check box exactly how you want it to be called, and include sample text before and after you set this check box?

 Thanks!
